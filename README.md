# Cycle Set
Implementation of a set (usually inherited from the languages standard set that works for cycle sets.  
## Why would I ever want to use this, can't I just use known formulas like $\dfrac{(n-1)!}{2}$ to count cycle permutations?
First off, most people won't want to use this and that is ok.  But you might find this useful if you are attempting to count cycle permutations with a very specific set of restrictions and you need to verify a formula.
